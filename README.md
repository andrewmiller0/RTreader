## Guidelines
Create website using languages of your choice. When you are finished with the site, create a pull request to submit your work.
 
The assumptions and details for the user stories are entirely up to you, add as much detail or as little detail as you like.
 
Style and design are also entirely up to you.

When you submit the final pull request, please send me an email explaining where you're at on the project as if I am Pat, the customer.
